# Funky-Finance Test

My attempt of the Funky Finance challenge

## Set-up Instructions

* Git clone this repository 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/etiennemustow/funky-finance-test.git
```
* Change into the directory
```
$ cd funky-finance-test
```
* Run the program
```
$ ruby ./lib/funky-finance.rb
```

## Running Tests

* To run tests in the console, run `rspec`

### Notes

Although not specified in the test and the program works, I'd have loved to edit some of the methods to disallow the same variable being entered twice (as it's a potential bug).
I'd have also liked to refactor some of my code as some of the methods seem repetitive.
I'd also have tried to make the program look a little nicer, UI-wise
